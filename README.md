# 🐧 RIOgpt — Multi-Model AI Chatbot

**RIOgpt** is a fun little side project I built that lets you chat with AI models — both **Google Gemini** and **OpenAI GPT-3.5**.  
It's got a clean interface, a friendly Rio mascot, and a simple dropdown to switch between models.

Basically, I wanted to make a lightweight AI chatbot with real-time responses — and this is version 2.0 of it.

## 🚀 How to Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RIOgpt.git
cd RIOgpt

2. install dependencies:
npm install

3. Create a .env file and add your API keys:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

4. Start the server:

⚠️ Notes
Gemini works for free (at the time of writing).
OpenAI API might require billing, or trial credits if you’re lucky.
If you get an error using OpenAI, it's probably a quota issue (check billing).
